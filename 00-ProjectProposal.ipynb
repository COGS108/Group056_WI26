More specifically, which clinical features are most predictive of Alzheimer’s diagnosis, and how well do supervised classification models (like logistic regression, random forest, etc) perform in distinguishing between Alzheimer’s and non-Alzheimer’s cases? To answer this, we will analyze how predictive performance metrics (accuracy, AUC, precision, recall) vary across models and identify key variables that contribute most to prediction.\n",

    "Alzheimer’s disease research has long relied on large, structured datasets to understand how dementia develops, how it is diagnosed, and which patient characteristics are most strongly associated with disease progression.  One of the most influential efforts in this area is the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which was established to systematically collect longitudinal clinical, demographic, cognitive, imaging, and biomarker data from individuals with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer’s disease.  These datasets reflect how Alzheimer’s status is investigated using a combination of patient characteristics alongside clinical indicators and health measurements. The ADNI study demonstrated that Alzheimer’s diagnosis and progression can be characterized meaningfully using a combination of standardized clinical assessments and patient-specific information, showing that predicting Alzheimer’s related outcomes from structured patient data is a well-established research direction. ¹ ²\n",
    "\tSimilarly, the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) provides longitudinal MRI and clinical data from older adults with and without dementia, enabling comparative analysis across cognitive states2. The OASIS project showed that structured datasets containing demographic information, cognitive scores, and clinical labels are valuable for distinguishing between healthy aging and Alzheimer’s-related decline. Together, ADNI and OASIS illustrate that Alzheimer’s research commonly integrates patient demographics with clinical indicators to study diagnosis and disease progression, and they have become benchmark datasets for evaluating predictive approaches.\n",
    "Building on these structured datasets, prior research has shown that supervised machine learning models can successfully classify Alzheimer’s disease status using routinely collected clinical variables, even without relying on imaging data or invasive biomarkers. Suresh et al. developed a lightweight machine learning framework that compared traditional linear models such as logistic regression with non-linear models including random forests to predict Alzheimer’s disease from clinical features. Their results demonstrated that machine learning approaches can achieve strong predictive performance using accessible patient data, while also allowing for analysis of feature importance to identify which variables contribute most to diagnostic decisions. These studies commonly evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), precision, and recall, since each metric captures different aspects of classification error.⁴  Many studies also look at which features are most significant to explain what models use to identify the strongest predictors of diagnosis. \n",
    "While ADNI and OASIS are commonly used to benchmark datasets in Alzheimer's research, our project will apply a similar approach in using accessible clinical datasheets, ours being from Kaggle. This Kaggle dataset includes diagnosis labels along with demographic, lifestyle, and health variables which make it suitable for analysis. Like prior machine learning approaches to Alzheimer’s predictions, we are able to compare models such as logistic regression and random forest and can evaluate them using accuracy, AUC, precision, or recall. We can also examine which features are contributing the most to predictions, which can help identify which patient variables are most important in distinguishing Alzheimer’s cases.\n",

    "Age will be the strongest predictor of Alzheimer’s diagnosis. This is because Alzheimer’s risk increases substantially with age, and many prior studies show age is one of the most consistent factors associated with dementia progression. Therefore, we expect models trained on demographic and health features will rely heavily on age to separate diagnosed vs. non-diagnosed individuals."

    "The ideal dataset would be a longitudinal study that essentially tracks the same people over several years , covering at least 5,000 - 10,000 participants to give the ML models enough to learn from. This data should be organized in a tidy table (a CSV or database), where each row represents a patient. It includes a diverse range of features: demographics (age, education), lifestyle habits (diet, exercise, smoking), and clinical markers (BMI, medical history). High quality data should ideally be collected by certified medical professionals using standardized tools ensuring that the control group is just as well-documented as the “Alzheimer’s” group in order to avoid bias in accuracy and ensuring that the model performs well on metrics such as precision and recall\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinodvadde/alzeimers-clinical-dataset\n",
    " This dataset is located on Kaggle and is a public dataset which can be used immediately by downloading the CSV file without needing a formal application or special permissions. Thist is particularly useful for this project because it contains a wide range of relevant variables including age, education level, and BMI, alongside lifestyle factors such as smoking and physical activity. These variables are important because they allow us to analyze how non-clinical, daily behaviors correlate with a patient's health status. While the sample shown focuses on these habits, the full dataset provides the necessary Diagnosis target variable required to train and evaluate supervised classification models like Random Forest.\n",

    "This dataset is located on Kaggle and can be downloaded and used immediately with a Kaggle account. This would be highly useful for this project because it provides longitudinal MRI data, allowing you to track how brain changes relate to the disease over time. The most important variables in this set are nWBV (Normalized Whole Brain Volume) and eTIV (Estimated Total Intracranial Volume), which provide \"hard\" clinical evidence of brain shrinkage. Additionally, it includes the CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating) and MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) scores, which act as the ground truth for diagnosing the severity of Alzheimer’s in each patient.\n",

It is particularly valuable for this project because it offers a much larger sample size (over 74,000 records) across diverse regions, which helps in testing how well models generalize to different populations. Key variables for your analysis include lifestyle and health indicators like PhysicalActivity, Smoking, and ChronicDiseases, alongside the Alzheimer's Diagnosis label. These features allow you to determine which lifestyle factors are the strongest predictors of the disease on a global scale.\n",

    "## Ethics \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This project uses an existing public dataset from Kaggle and does not involve collecting new data from human subjects. Because we are not directly interacting with participants or gathering data ourselves, informed consent is not something we can obtain or control within the scope of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset used in this project does not include direct personally identifying information such as names, addresses, or contact information. Since we are working with an already-published dataset and are not collecting additional personal details, PII exposure is not a major concern in this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since we are not collecting data from individuals and the dataset is public, we do not have a mechanism to remove a specific person’s information. This checklist item is more relevant to organizations that store user-submitted data and can respond to removal requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " > This project uses a static dataset for a course analysis and does not involve long-term storage of sensitive personal data. Since the dataset is public and not continuously updated by us, a formal data retention plan is not necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " -  [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> This model is not being deployed as a real-world system and will only be used for exploratory analysis within a course context. Because there is no production deployment, monitoring for concept drift or real-world performance changes is not applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since our project is not deployed to users and does not make real-world decisions, there is no direct risk of harm to individuals through model outputs. As a result, a formal redress process is not necessary for this academic project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">Our work is not deployed in a production environment, so there is no system to roll back or disable. This checklist item applies more to real deployed machine learning products.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
